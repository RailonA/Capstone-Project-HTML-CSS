> This project is the HTML and CSS capstone project, I built an art store  directory that allows users to scroll through items for sale, this project has 2 pages which are :

- The main page: the main page where all the items are displayed
- The search results page: This page displays the items in more of a narrow way regarding price points and items the customer is looking for.
